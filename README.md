Visualizing bike sharing data through Tableau


## Overview of bikesharing Analysis

The bikesharing analysis is to understand how it works in New York City so that the concepts can be used to setup a bikesharing business in another city

## Resources
**Data Source:** csv files for bikesharing details of NYC for year 2019
**Software:** Tableau 

## Results

The following important analysis was done using visualizations in Tableau:

- Checkout Times for Users: The checkout time for users is highest in the first hour and subsequently it reduces. The next step is to see the checkout time by gender. This will help in understanding the demographics of the bikers.

- The pie chart shows that the  biker gender base has a higher percentage of males compared to females

- Checkout Times by Gender shows that the trip duration is higher for males compared to females. So we can infer that there are more male bikers in NYC

- Trips by Weekday per hour shows evenings as busier times compared to nights and very early mornings. Thursday through Saturdays tend to be busiest.

- Trips by Gender gives two important insights. Filtering on gender shows that males are taking almost 3 times more bikes than females. The pattern shows that both males and females are biking around similar hours but more males are biking than females

- This visual helps us understand that there are more subscribers than one off customers and males make up a higher percentage of the customer base

## Summary

The different tableau visuals have helped the team to understand the basic needs of a bike sharing business. These insights will be used to set up a similar business in another city. A thorough data analysis beforehand will reduce the risk of the business having loopholes while being setup.

Two additional visuals that could help here could be as follows:

- Rides by Month to get the peak month where bike sharing business is at the highest and also to see when the business would not be in much demand

- Subscribers by month to see if the subscription is affected by months and which month has highest / lowest subscription
